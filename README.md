        <h1>About the PTSD Analysis Web Application</h1>
        <p>The PTSD Analysis Web Application is a comprehensive solution designed to detect emotional states in individuals through multiple modalities. This platform combines advanced machine learning techniques with real-time interaction to provide users with personalized emotional support and feedback. The goal of this application is to assist individuals who may suffer from PTSD by analyzing various forms of emotional expression, such as speech tone, facial expressions, and chatbot interactions.</p>

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <ul class="list-style">
            <li><span class="highlight">Speech Emotion Detection:</span> Identifies emotions in spoken language by analyzing the tone, pitch, and frequency of speech.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Speech Frequency Emotion Detection:</span> Detects emotional states based on variations in speech frequencies.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Face Emotion Detection:</span> Recognizes emotions by analyzing facial expressions in images or live video streams.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Chatbot:</span> Provides an empathetic conversational interface that interacts with the user and detects emotional states through text-based conversations.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Feedback Collection:</span> Gathers user input and suggestions to enhance the user experience and improve emotional analysis accuracy.</li>
